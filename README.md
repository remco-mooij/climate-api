Climate Flask API
Using Python and SQLalchemy, [climate analysis and data exploration](https://github.com/remco-mooij/climate-app/blob/master/climate_analysis.ipynb) was performed on a [climate database](https://github.com/remco-mooij/climate-app/blob/master/Resources/hawaii.sqlite).
The data was used to calculate the minimum, maximum and average temperatures on Hawaii between July 1 - 14 to plan for a trip to Honolulu.

A Flask API was designed based on the SQLAlchemy ORM queries that were developed. This API has the following available routes:


/ (home page with list of available routes)


/api/v1.0/precipitation


/api/v1.0/stations


/api/v1.0/tobs


/api/v1.0/(enter_start_date)


/api/v1.0/(enter_start_date)/(enter_end_date)
